# RESTful API Practice
#### Develop RESTful API for managing products and categories
> A client should be able to perform CRUD operations for Product and Category resources.
#### Database
- Postgresql
- Hibernate DB for integration testing
#### Authentication
- Have two roles defined as follows:
  - ADMIN: the super user role that can manipulate categories and products.
  - USER: a user role that can manipulate only products that were created by that user.
#### API Documentation: Swagger UI
#### Devops: docker, docker-compose, github-actions
